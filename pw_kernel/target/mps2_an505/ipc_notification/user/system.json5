// IPC Notification Test System Configuration for ARM Cortex-M33 (mps2_an505)
//
// This configuration sets up:
// - A "client" app that initiates IPC transactions (like a client task)
// - A "server" app that handles IPC requests (like a driver task)
//
// The channel connects client → server via channel_initiator/channel_handler pair.
