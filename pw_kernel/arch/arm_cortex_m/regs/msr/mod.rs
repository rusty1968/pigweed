//! MSR (Move to Special Register) definitions
//!
//! This module contains CONTROL register definitions, conditionally
//! including architecture-specific variants:
//! - ARMv7-M: Bits 0-2 only (nPRIV, SPSEL, FPCA)
//! - ARMv8-M: Bits 0-7 (adds SFPA, BTI, PAC fields)

/// Stack-pointer selection (shared between architectures)
